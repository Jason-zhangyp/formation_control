Further improvements:

- [ ] add critical failure handler for real vehicle with problems
- [ ] visualize a communication graph of all the agents (with real vehicle could be non complete)
- [ ] add external controller for target statistic (joystick)
- [ ] add Gazebo simulation (car URDF model + ROS control + MoveIt)
